So while working on the project, I documented few errors I came across
1. Not using the EC2 instance IP address
2. Uisng different topic name for the producer and consumer code
3. For kafka version 2.2.1 which is not the latest version use "broker-list" for starting the producer channel 
4. In s3 bucket while querying we might save the data in a sub folder and run the crawler on the main file so check for the path while running the crawler on s3 bucket
